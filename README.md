# PouchDB, Angular 4, and Couchbase Example

Example project for synchronizing documents between platforms and Couchbase with only Angular 2 and PouchDB.

## The Requirements

This project depends on the following dependencies in order to be successful:

* Node.js 4.0+
* Angular 4 CLI
* Couchbase Sync Gateway

To develop Angular 4 applications you need the Angular CLI which is downloadable via the Node Package Manager (NPM) found in Node.js.  For synchronization at least one Couchbase Sync Gateway instance must be available.

## Installation and Configuration

Download the project from GitHub and execute the following to download all of the Angular 4 project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

With the dependencies installed, use launch Sync Gateway with the **sync-gateway-config.json** configuration file found at the root of the project.

In the project's **src/app/app.component.ts** file, change the hostname to match that of your Sync Gateway instance.

The project can be sampled by executing:

```
ng serve
```

The above command will serve the application at http://www.localhost:4200.
